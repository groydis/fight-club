        Terms & Conditions
      </h1>

      <p class="text-sm text-zinc-400 italic">
        Welcome to Fight Club, where the code is janky, the features are fragile, and the only guarantee is chaos.
      </p>

      <section class="space-y-6 text-sm text-zinc-300">

        <div>
          <h2 class="font-bold text-zinc-100 mb-1">1. This is Alpha as Hell</h2>
          <p>
            Fight Club is in early alpha. Bugs will happen. Features may break. Characters might vanish. Use it at your own risk.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="font-bold text-zinc-100 mb-1">2. No Warranty, No Refunds</h2>
          <p>
            We don’t promise this thing works. There are no warranties, no guarantees, and absolutely no refunds (not that you're paying anything).
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="font-bold text-zinc-100 mb-1">3. Data Collection</h2>
          <p>
            We collect the bare minimum — your email and whatever chaos you create in-app. No tracking, no creepy ads, no shady data sales.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="font-bold text-zinc-100 mb-1">4. Don't Be a Dick</h2>
          <p>
            Don’t exploit bugs, harass other users, or be generally awful. If you do, we reserve the right to delete your account and possibly launch it into the sun.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="font-bold text-zinc-100 mb-1">5. Updates May Break Stuff</h2>
          <p>
            We ship fast and loose. Don’t be shocked if things break, move, or disappear without warning. It’s all part of the vibe.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="font-bold text-zinc-100 mb-1">6. Intellectual Property</h2>
          <p class="mb-2">
            Don’t create characters that intentionally infringe on copyrighted material, trademarks, or known IP. That means no Mickey Mouse, Goku, or whatever you're thinking.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2">
            Any resemblance to existing IP is purely coincidental. We don’t encourage copying, and we’re not liable if you try to get clever and get sued.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2">
            Parody and satire might be protected under fair use — but that doesn’t mean you’re safe. Use common sense. We reserve the right to remove anything that smells like an IP lawsuit.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="font-bold text-zinc-100 mb-1">7. User Responsibility</h2>
          <p>
            You’re responsible for what you create. We don’t actively police content, but we can and will delete anything that causes legal or moral migraines.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="font-bold text-zinc-100 mb-1">8. Contact Us</h2>
          <p>
